# Graphical User Interface

The gui can be used by calling `kbvs.py`.
```
$ python kbvs.py
```
When you have python2 and python3 installed, you may need to run the application with `python3` instead of `python`:
```
$ python3 kbvs.py
```

## Start-Window and Menu

When starting the application the following window will be displayed:

When changing the zoom direction, zoom rate or scale mode the preview is updated.

Additionally the slides can be moved to the right with the keyboard shortcut "s" and to the left with the keyboard shortcut "a" (thanks to [@ch00f](https://github.com/Trekky12/kburns-slideshow/pull/17)).

### Select slide

The next slide can be selected with the keyboard shortcut "right arrow" and the previous slide with the keyboard shortcut "left arrow" (thanks to [@ch00f](https://github.com/Trekky12/kburns-slideshow/pull/17)).

## Create Video

On the bottom of the window the slideshow video duration is shown. Additionally the duration of all audio files is displayed.
To prevent no background music at the end of the video you need to make sure that the audio files duration is greater than the video duration.

If the image durations should be synced to matching audio positions the button `Sync Video to Audio` needs to be pressed.
Therefore the `aubioonset` executable is used in the background.

The resulting video can be created by pressing `Create Video`. Please note that the gui does not respond to input while creating FFmpeg creates the video.
